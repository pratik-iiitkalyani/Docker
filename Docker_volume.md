# Docker Volume
What are Volumes?
- Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers
- In Docker, Whenever you create a container, there has to be some place where the data for the container will be stored, in case you do not provide
any explicit location for that data to be stored it gets stored in the container and when you delete the container or remove the container the data is also lost
- when we worked on enterprise projects we want data is not lost, when we remove a container but still persist the data and in case it is required to create more container with the old data or 
to share the data between the container so it should be possiable

Use of Volumes
===========
- Decoupling(seperate) container from storage
- Share volume (storage/data) among different containers
- Attach volume to container
- On deleting container volume does not delete
